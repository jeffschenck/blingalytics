Requirements
------------

For a very basic infrastructure, Python is the only dependency:

* Python_ >= 2.5

Some of the caches and sources have other dependencies, but they are only
required if you're actually using those particular source and cache engines.
The documentation for that module will specify what its dependencies are,
which may include:

* Redis_
* `redis-py`_
